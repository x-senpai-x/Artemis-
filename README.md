## Overview

Artemis represents a paradigm shift in cross-chain interoperability by introducing an intent-based settlement system powered by AI agents. Instead of relying on traditional bridges or atomic swaps, Artemis allows users to express their trading intentions, which are then executed by specialized AI agents operating within secure Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

## Key Features

- **Intent-Based Trading**: Users simply specify what they want to trade and receive, without worrying about the underlying complexity of cross-chain operations.

- **AI-Powered Price Discovery**: Intelligent agents continuously monitor multiple DEXs and liquidity sources across supported chains to find the best possible prices.

- **Secure Execution**: All operations are executed within LIT Protocol's MPC-TEE environment, ensuring both security and privacy of user transactions.

- **Cross-Chain Settlement**: Seamless trading across different blockchain networks including Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, and more.

- **Atomic Execution**: All trades are executed atomically, eliminating the risk of partial trades or stuck transactions.

## Technical Components



1. **CDP Kit for Agent Development**
   - Framework for building and deploying AI agents
   - Implements price discovery algorithms
   - Manages agent coordination and competition

2. **LIT Protocol Integration**
   - Provides secure TEE environment for agent execution
   - Ensures private and secure transaction processing
   - Manages cryptographic proofs and attestations

3. **Proof of Attestation System**
   - Validates new agents joining the network
   - Maintains reputation system for AI agents
   - Ensures quality and reliability of price discovery
  
4. **Socket Protocol Integration**
   - Handles cross-chain message passing and intent settlement
   - Ensures atomic execution of multi-chain transactions
   - Manages state synchronization across different networks

## How It Works

1. **Intent Submission**
   - User submits their trading intention through the interface
   - System captures desired input and output tokens across chains
   - Intent is formatted and encrypted for agent processing

2. **Agent Processing**
   - AI agents receive the intent within the TEE
   - Multiple agents compete to find the best execution path
   - Optimal routes and prices are discovered across supported DEXs

3. **Secure Execution**
   - Winning agent's execution plan is validated
   - Multi-chain transactions are atomic and secure
   - Socket Protocol ensures cross-chain settlement

4. **Settlement Verification**
   - Transaction completion is verified across all chains
   - Proofs are generated and stored
   - User receives confirmed transaction details

## Supported Networks

Currently, Artemis supports the following networks:
- Ethereum
- Polygon
- Base
- Arbitrum
- [Additional networks coming soon]

## Security Considerations

- All agent executions occur within LIT Protocol's secure TEE
- Multi-layer validation prevents malicious agent behavior
- Regular security audits and attestation checks
- Decentralized execution prevents single points of failure

## Getting Started

To start using Artemis:

1. Visit the Artemis web interface
2. Connect your Web3 wallet
3. Select your input token and desired output token
4. Submit your trading intent
5. Confirm the transaction when prompted

## Development

To set up the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[username]/Artemis

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
